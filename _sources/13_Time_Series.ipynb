    "## Components of a Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A general times series can be thought of as been composed by four different parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **trend**: it is the long-run smooth and regular movement of the series\n",
    "  * The **cycle**: it is the oscillatory part of the the trend that represents a smooth and continuous evolution in the long-run (repeated each certain years)\n",
    "  * The **seasonality**: it is the systematic repeated pattern observed \"yearly\" in the series\n",
    "  * The **irregular component**: it is represented by the random errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since the cycle is sometimes assumed to be part of the trend, since both represent the long-run and then trend consists in a *pure trend* part and the *oscillatory trend*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different ways in which we may combine the different components into just one single time series, but in general we may say that the response $y_i$ is a function\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "y_i = f(T_i,\\,C_i,,S_i,\\,I_i)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "  This function may represent one of the following three schemes\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Additive scheme**: This is the case in which the components are represented in terms of a linear combination\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  y_i = T_i + C_i + S_i + I_i\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  this case is used whenever there is not a high variability of the series along time. The series in case is known as **linear** or **arithmetic**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Multiplicative scheme**: In this case we represent the output as the product of all the components, then\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  y_i = T_i\\cdot C_i \\cdot S_i\\cdot I_i\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  this scheme is used when it is much better to represent the changes in terms of percentages than in absolute terms. Generally, whenever the varaibility of the series is not constant long time. The series in case is known as **exponential** or **geometric**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **Mixed scheme**: In this case we typically have the trend, cycle and seasonality in a multiplicative scheme and the irregular component in addicitve scheme\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  y_i = (T_i \\cdot C_i \\cdot S_i) + I_i\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "  \n",
    "  this scheme is relevant when the variability of the seasonal oscillations can be assumed to be constant but their magnitude grows with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we have a multiplicative scheme, it will always be transformed into an additive one by means of a logarithmic transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "  \\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\log(y_i) = \\log(T_i) + \\log(C_i) +\\log(S_i) + \\log(I_i)\n",
    "  \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "then whatever techinque that may be applied to the additive scheme can be applied to the multiplicative one if it has been transformed already."

    "## Box-Jenkins Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now make a summary of the general Box-Jenkins methodology for ARIMA models:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Collect the data**: Box and Jenkins recommend a minimum of 50 observations and, when working with monthly series have between 6 and 10 years of information (similar bounds for other seasonal periods).\n",
    " * **Represent the series**: Always make the graphical representation of the series. This may let us identify different properties as schemes, trends or stationarity. An interesting tool is that of the moving averages or standard deviations to detect if the statistical properties are changing with time.\n",
    " * **Transform the series**: If the series is not stationary or we detect a precise scheme we should always consider the transformation of variables. Typically into logarithms, but we can do a more general Box-Cox type transformation.\n",
    " * **Remove trends**: By decomposition or by direct observation of the graph we can detect the existence and type of a trend. There are different ways to remove it: differences or analytically. In the ARIMA model we can consider that if the trend is **linear** then we take d=1 and for a non-linear trend we use d=2 (the python function does not allow for higher values of d).\n",
    " * **Identify the model**: Identify the order of the autorregressive and moving averages of the regular and seasonal components. In absence of any other guide, take $(p, q)\\in[1,2]$ with all their combinations. These values should be found by means of the autocorrelation or partial correlation functions and graphs (take a look at the **acf** and **pacf** functions from **statsmodels.tsa.stattools** module as well as to the **plot_acf** and **plot_pacf** from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots) as well as by minimization of the different information criteria. If we have doubts with respect to which model we should take, estimate some of them and compare later (with respect to this, see if the ARIMA(2,1,2) would be better than the ARIMA(3,1,3) we have found before)\n",
    " * **Estimate the coefficients**: Usual estimation process.\n",
    " * **Validate the model**: There are many different tests that can be made to validate the model. One option similar to one that we have covered in linear regression is that when the model does not actully fit the observed series, the residuals will be autocorrelated values. In this case we should use **Durbin-Watson** for first order autocorrelation or **Wallis** for fourth order autocorrelations.\n",
    " * **Analyize the errors**: This is the usual residuals study, mostly looking for high residual points (outliers) where the difference between the prediction and the observed values is too different\n",
    " * **Select the model**: In view of the previous steps, select one of the models.\n",
    " * **Forecasting**: Once we have the model we can use it as the basis for forecasting."
