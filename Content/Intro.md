# Preface

The notes in these documents correspond to the topics given during the sessions for the **Math and Stats** course in the IE Exponential Learning Programme. 

They will be dynamically completed and corrected as typos are found or topics are in need of a review. By now they are in a very skeletal-like shape so expect deep changes in them.
