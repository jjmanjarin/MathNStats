Suppose we are performing a test on the effectiveness of a new medicine, in particular let's say we have a control group and a treatment group and then we first want to see if there is significant difference between the way the medicine acts in both groups (the null hypothesis would be that there is not), but now we want to go a bit farther since it would be dangerous if the levels of a blood component are depressed too much, then we may want to know what is the probability that if this drop actually occurs, we may detect it from the data of our sample. This last probability is precisely the power of the test.\n",

    "The power of the test may be computed in two different ways (results will be different but in the same direction).

The second method implies choosing as significance level the p-value and then we make explicit use of the sample mean value as defining the boundary of the critical region. If we are going to compute the power using R we must understand that it is the first option the one used in the functions, and then we do not need to use our data set as argument of the functions.

Typically we will require a value for the power of the test between $80\\%$ and $90\\%$. If we impose a power, the only paramenter that may change is the sample size for a fixed significance level. This in turn implies that we should not use the p-value in this computation: if we could vary the sample size the p-value would change too, then we proceed by considering an $\\alpha$ and then imposing a $\\beta$ to determine the smaple size.

    "## How to Choose the Significance Level\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important point is that of what significance level we should choose for a study and, of course, since they are not independent, this affects the value of the power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is that the significance level must reflect the importance of the consequences of a type I error. In the same sense, the election of $\\beta$ should reflect the consequences of a type II error, however, since decreasing $\\alpha$ increases $\\beta$ for the same sample size, we must be careful with this election.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug and in some previous tests they have found that it makes a great job with the illness it fights, but at the same time it has been detected some unwilling side effects that may result in the sudden death of the patient, then they are considering a new test in order to see if they should extend the studies or not. This scheme can be written as \n",

    "H_0:\\{\\text{side effects}\\},\\quad H_1:\\{\\text{no side effects}\\}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case, if our decision is a type I error, it implies that we may say that the drug does not produce the side effects when it truly does. Since we may want to minimize the probability that we fall into this wrong decision we should choose the smallest possible $\\alpha$ (in our previous discussions, the $1\\%$). However, if the unwilling side effects are related to headaches, nauseas or dizziness, the company may relax the $\\alpha$ to a $10\\%$ since it is not a high risk situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of situation is what makes us require very small p-values when performing some crucial experiments, for example, in particle physics, quality control or in other real life situations it is usually required that the p-value is located at 5 or 6 standard deviations from the null hypothesis. A value of 6 sigmas means that the probability outside of the null hypothesis in each tail of a two-tailed test is $0.00017\\%$ and so, the p-value is $1.7\\cdot 10^{-6}$, i.e. if the results were due to chance and we repeat the experiment 3.4 million times we expect that only 1 of them replicates the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to impose both, a small significance level and a high power of the test is by increasing the sample size. This just will allow us to have balanced and small $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We can see this in the examples above using R as\\\\\n",
